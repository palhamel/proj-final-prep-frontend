# Final project @ Technigo Bootcamp - Frontend

A small website about prepping and prepper kits for urban city environments. 
The website is in Swedish and a easy tool for keeping you up to date with the latest news from SMHI, SVT, WHO and NY Times.
Also lot's of info regarding prepping and how to handle loss of water, heat, electricity and more.
Here you can also explore "prepper kits", in different sizes, and buy them via our external partner.

Being prepared is smart.
